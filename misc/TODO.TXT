1. Add a function to allow for in-program input
    - if user doesn't have a file to parse, give them the option
        to enter a matrix manually index by index
            - after they finish entering their manual matrix, there
                would be a "are you sure" screen to double check their
                values
                    - if their values aren't what they meant to put in,
                        the program will ask which position in the matrix
                        needs to be changed
