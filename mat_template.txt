Rows are seperated by a ; while columns are seperated by a space
    or they can be presented as a the traditional typed out way
    (*for now, this program only works with 2D Matrices)

When providing your matrix files, the program will search for semicolons
    within your matrices. If a semicolon(s) are present, the program will
    assume you mean to use the one-line representation instead of the visual
    representation

If your input files withold just integers, the output of the matrix arithmetic
    will output the values with a decimal after them even if they are whole
    numbers. This is not a bug, it is just how numpy.float128 data types
    are handled

EXAMPLE (2x5 one-line):
1 2 3 4 5; 6 7 8 9 10

EXAMPLE (2x5 visually represented)
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
